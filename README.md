# i3wmarchdark

This is my configuration for I3 improved tiling to be used on any archlinux distribution.

In the installation folder is all the data for you need to have a great working environment but not directly a dekstop environment.

I suggest you read up to better understand what a tiling window manager is but is really great once you have mastered the most important shortcuts.
